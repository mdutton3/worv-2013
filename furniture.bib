	abstract = {<p>We report on our experiences regarding the acquisition of hybrid Semantic 3D Object Maps for indoor household environments, in particular kitchens, out of sensed 3D point cloud data. Our proposed approach includes a processing pipeline, including geometric mapping and learning, for processing large input datasets and for extracting relevant objects useful for a personal robotic assistant to perform complex manipulation tasks. The type of objects modeled are objects which perform utilitarian functions in the environment such as kitchen appliances, cupboards, tables, and drawers. The resulted model is accurate enough to use it in physics-based simulations, where doors of 3D containers can be opened based on their hinge position. The resulted map is represented as a hybrid concept and is comprised of both the hierarchically classified objects and triangular meshes used for collision avoidance in manipulation routines.</p>},

To do that the point cloud is first converted to a range image and then a new type of feature is extracted based on points of interested found by a harris detector. They use eucldian distance a vector space spanned by the feature vectors to find candidates. GOODSAC is used to find a model transformation. false positives are getting recjected based on a score function with a scaled range image. NO learning involved!
